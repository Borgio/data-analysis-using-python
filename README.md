# 1. Introduction

NYC Open Data provides a treasure-trove of information - all publicly available with a click of a button. While having access to data is great, its analysis is often a difficult process for beginners, potentially creating barriers in one's open data journey. Additionally, performing data analysis in a reproducible way is often limited or even discarded altogether.

*Data Analysis Using Python: A Beginner’s Guide Featuring NYC Open Data* is a four-part series as listed in the sections below. These collection of notebooks serve as references/user guides for how to apply Python to real-world Data Analysis projects. The repository features notebooks that will utilize the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) and datasets from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/). This series exemplifies how data analytics can be used for discovering useful information and supporting decision-making.

Sections include:

Part 1: [Reading and Writing Files in Python](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/tree/master/1-reading-writing-files).
 
Part 2: [Data Inspection, Cleaning, and Wrangling in Python](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/tree/master/2-data-inspection-cleaning-wrangling).

Part 3: [Plotting and Data Visualization in Python](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/tree/master/3-plotting-data-visualizations).

Part 4: [Geospatial Data and Mapping](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/tree/master/4-geospatial-data-mapping).

You can run an interactive example on MyBinder through your browser - no installation required: click here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/HEAD?filepath=mybinder-examples%2Fexamples.ipynb). Loading MyBinder is a bit slow and takes ~5 minutes, but it will load eventually.

# 3. Data 

| Dataset | Description |
| :-------- | :---------- |
| [Building Footprints](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/Building-Footprints/nqwf-w8eh) | Shapefile of footprint outlines of buildings in New York City. |
| [MapPLUTO](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-pluto-mappluto.page) | MapPLUTO merges PLUTO tax lot data with tax lot features from the Department of Finance’s Digital Tax Map (DTM) and is available as shoreline clipped and water included. It contains extensive land use and geographic data at the tax lot level in ESRI shapefile and File Geodatabase formats. |
| [Schools](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/School-Point-Locations/jfju-ynrr) | This is an ESRI shape file of school point locations based on the official address.  It includes some additional basic and pertinent information needed to link to other data sources. It also includes some basic school information such as Name, Address, Principal, and Principal’s contact information. |
| [Streets](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NYC-Street-Centerline-CSCL-/exjm-f27b) | The NYC Street Centerline (CSCL) is a road-bed representation of New York City streets containing address ranges and other information such as traffic directions, road types, segment types. |
| [Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTA-/cpf4-rkhq) | Boundaries of Neighborhood Tabulation Areas as created by the NYC Department of City Planning using whole census tracts from the 2010 Census as building blocks. These aggregations of census tracts are subsets of New York City's 55 Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). |
| [NYC Boroughs](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Borough-Boundaries/tqmj-j8zm) | GIS data: Boundaries of Boroughs (water areas excluded). |
