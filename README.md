# 1 Executive Summary


# 2 Introduction

This repository includes notebooks that will be explored in this series **A Beginner's Guide to Data Analysis Using Python.**

If you want to have your own copy of the repository on your machine, you can  __clone__ the repository on your machine as

```
git clone https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python.git
```
That way if I make changes you can update them locally on your machine with 

```
git pull
```

but you will not be able to make changes to my repository.

Otherwise, if you want the repository on your account with the ability to make changes _to your own copy_, you can __fork__ the repository and have your own copy in your github account (it will be at http://github.com/<username>/data-analysis-using-python).
 
 _If you see a mistake and you want to propose a change, you can submit a pull request, but be very clear about the change and its motivation in the description of your pull request._
