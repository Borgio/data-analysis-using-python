# Data Analysis Using Python: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide Featuring NYC Open Data  

## Part 1: Reading and Writing Files in Python  
Mark Bauer

**Introduction**  
Part 1 demonstrates various ways to read (load) and write (save) data using the Python programming language. The datasets contain common file formats such as comma-separated values (csv), JavaScript Object Notation (json), shapefiles (i.e. format for geometric location and attribute information) and zip files. The project is located in my notebook [1_reading_writing_files.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/blob/master/1-reading-writing-files/1_reading_writing_files.ipynb). Additionally, you can view the notebook as a static webpage [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/blob/master/1-reading-writing-files/1_reading_writing_files.ipynb).
