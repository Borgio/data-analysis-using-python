**Data Analysis Using Python: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide Featuring NYC Open Data**

Part 1: Reading and Writing Files in Python

**Introduction**  
Part 1 demonstrates various ways to read (load) and write (save) data using the Python programming language. The datasets contain common file formats such as comma-separated values (csv), JavaScript Object Notation (json), shapefiles (i.e. format for geometric location and attribute information) and zip files.
