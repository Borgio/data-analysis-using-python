# Data Analysis Using Python: A Beginnerâ€™s Guide Featuring NYC Open Data  

## Part 2: Data Inspection, Cleaning and Wrangling in Python  
**Mark Bauer**

**Introduction**  
Part 2 demonstrates various ways to to inspect, clean, wrangle, and detect any outliers in your data. The project is located in my notebook [2-data-inspection-cleaning-wrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/blob/master/2-data-inspection-cleaning-wrangling/2-data-inspection-cleaning-wrangling.ipynb).

Key sections as follows:

Data Inspection  
* Previewing Data  
* Calcualting Summary Statistics
* Identifying Null/NA Values
       
       
Data Cleaning & Wrangling  
* Previewing Column Values
* Identifying Outliers in Column
* Replacing Outliers with Null/NA Values
* Dropping Null/NA Values
* Filling In Null/NA Values With Median
       
       
Detecting Outliers  
* Making a Box Plot  
  * Calculating Interquartile Range (IQR)
  * Box Plot of Construction Year Values
  * Making Histograms of Values Above and Below Box Plot Whiskers
* Z-Scores  
  * Calculating Z-Scores
  * Identifying Possible Outliers from Z-Score
  * Making Histograms of Construction Year Raw and Normalized (Z-Score) Values
