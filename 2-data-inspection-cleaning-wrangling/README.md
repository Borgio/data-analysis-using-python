## Part 2: Data Inspection, Cleaning and Wrangling in Python  
Mark Bauer

**Introduction**  
Part 2 demonstrates various ways to to inspect, clean, wrangle, and detect any outliers in your data. The project is located in my notebook [2_data_inspection_cleaning_wrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/blob/master/2-data-inspection-cleaning-wrangling/2_data_inspection_cleaning_wrangling.ipynb). Additionally, you can view the notebook as a static webpage [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mebauer/data-analysis-using-python/blob/master/2-data-inspection-cleaning-wrangling/2_data_inspection_cleaning_wrangling.ipynb).

Key sections as follows:

Data Inspection  
* Previewing Data  
* Calcualting Summary Statistics
* Identifying Null Values     
       
Data Cleaning & Wrangling  
* Previewing Column Values
* Making Box Plots
* Identifying Outliers in Column
* Dropping Null Values
* Filling In Null Values With Median

Sample Analysis
* Timeseries of Year Built
* Attempting to Identify the Oldest Building in NYC
